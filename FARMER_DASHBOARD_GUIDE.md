## 🎓 Understanding the Output

### **Net Profit**
- This is what the farmer keeps after all costs
- **Formula:** Revenue - Total Cost
- **Example:** ₹240,000 revenue - ₹90,000 cost = ₹150,000 profit

### **ROI (Return on Investment)**
- How much profit per rupee spent
- **Formula:** (Profit / Cost) × 100
- **Example:** ₹150,000 / ₹90,000 = 166.7% ROI
- **Meaning:** For every ₹1 spent, earn ₹1.67

### **Profit Margin**
- What % of revenue is profit
- **Formula:** (Profit / Revenue) × 100
- **Example:** ₹150,000 / ₹240,000 = 62.5%
- **Meaning:** 62.5% of sales is profit, 37.5% is cost

### **Profit per kg**
- Profit on each kg produced
- **Formula:** Total Profit / Total Production
- **Example:** ₹150,000 / 4000 kg = ₹37.50/kg
- **Meaning:** Earn ₹37.50 for each kg of crop
