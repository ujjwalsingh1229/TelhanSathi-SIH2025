# 🌾 TelhanSathi – Smart Oilseed Advisory Platform (SIH 2025)

TelhanSathi is an AI-powered digital platform developed under **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025** to promote sustainable and profitable oilseed cultivation in India. The project leverages **predictive analytics, market intelligence, and government scheme integration** to help farmers make informed crop decisions and reduce dependency on edible oil imports.

---

## 📌 Background

Indian farmers are increasingly shifting from oilseeds to crops like paddy, sugarcane, and maize due to assured procurement and price stability. As a result, oilseeds are mostly grown in marginal and rainfed areas, limiting productivity and expansion. This trend poses a serious risk to India’s **edible oil self-sufficiency mission** and increases import dependency.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement (SIH 2025)

Lack of price assurance, weak market linkages, and limited access to real-time information make oilseed cultivation less attractive. Farmers need a **technology-driven platform** that provides crop economics, price insights, risk mitigation, and access to government support schemes.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

TelhanSathi provides an end-to-end decision-support system that:

* Uses **predictive analytics** to evaluate oilseed profitability
* Offers **comparative crop economics** against alternative crops
* Integrates **market intelligence and real-time price alerts**
* Connects farmers with **government schemes** such as NMEO-OS
* Reduces market risk through **FPO linkages and assurance tools**

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🌱 **Crop Recommendation Engine** – Suggests suitable oilseed crops based on location, soil, season, and resources
* 📈 **Yield Prediction Model** – Estimates expected yield (quintals/acre)
* 💰 **Price Forecasting** – Uses time-series models (ARIMA/SARIMA) for price prediction
* 📊 **Profitability Simulator** – Calculates expected profit per acre
* 🌦️ **Weather-based Advisories** – Supports risk-aware farming decisions
* 🏆 **Gamification & Incentives** – Encourages expansion of oilseed acreage

---
